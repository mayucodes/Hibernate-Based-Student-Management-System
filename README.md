# Hibernate-Based-Student-Management-System
Developed a Java application emphasizing Object-Oriented Design principles and leveraging Hibernate for smooth database interactions. 

Key aspects include:
- Maven Project Setup: Created a Maven project with appropriate GroupId and ArtifactId in Eclipse.

- Dependency Management: Added dependencies for MySQL Connector and Hibernate Core in the pom.xml file.

- Database Setup: Configured a MySQL database using XAMPP, including the creation of a "studentinfo" database and a "student" table with specified columns.

- Entity Class: Developed a Student class as a Java Persistence API (JPA) entity, demonstrating Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) principles.

- Hibernate Configuration: Created a HibernateUtil Java configuration file to manage Hibernate settings, including database connection details.

- Data Access Objects (DAO): Designed an interface IStudentDao with CRUD methods and implemented it in the StudentDao class using Hibernate transactions.

- Main Application: Developed a test application (App class) to perform CRUD operations on the Student entity, showcasing the practical use of Hibernate.

Objective: Mastering the application of Hibernate in Java for effective Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and database connectivity.

Technologies Used:
Hibernate 6.1.7.Final
Eclipse IDE
XAMPP Server
Maven 3.5.3
JavaSE 20
MySQL 8.0.32
